## Description
The **Book's Brightness** web app is designed thoughtfully, with various features grouped into clear categories. This README file provides a detailed overview of the project's structure, explains each file's purpose, and sheds light on the reasons behind specific design choices I made during the development.
Project Structure
### Templates:

The index template serves as the catalog for the shop's products. It provides the user with the content of the website. 

The products template displays all products . 

The index is the main template of the project. It contains the nav bar, the footer, and the features sections. In the design of this template, I tried to maintain a minimalistic and modern design. I searched for multiple inspirations online to choose a specific structure for my website. I noticed that library shops tend to be bland and classic design-wise, so I wanted to break free from that.
 I added a unique design features section. The navbar is fixed while scrolling, so the user can easily navigate through different pages without having to scroll up. There are multiple ways to do that, but I thought this way looked best. 
 The main section displays the index template.
