# Book's Brightness
### Description
The **Book's Brightness** web app is designed thoughtfully, with various features grouped into clear categories. This README file provides a detailed overview of the project's structure, explains each file's purpose, and sheds light on the reasons behind specific design choices I made during the development.
Project Structure
### Templates:

*The templates folder contains multiple static templates (e.g., company information templates).*

To enhance the user's sense of engagement and personalization, the user profile contains user information and his order history. The design is simple, and the colors are a black-to-white transition.
The index template serves as the catalog for the shop's products. It provides the user with the content of the website. I used a sample of products from online pages (I mentioned that in the acknowledgment file) to illustrate the outcome of the final product.


The products template displays all products . 

The layout is the main template of the project. It contains the nav bar, the footer, and the features sections. In the design of this template, I tried to maintain a minimalistic and modern design. I searched for multiple inspirations online to choose a specific structure for my website. I noticed that library shops tend to be bland and classic design-wise, so I wanted to break free from that.
 I added a unique design features section. The navbar is fixed while scrolling, so the user can easily navigate through different pages without having to scroll up. There are multiple ways to do that, but I thought this way looked best. 
 The main section displays the index template. 

## Statistics:

The statistics folder consists of the images and CSS files, with distinct CSS files created for each template group. This organization ensures a cohesive and visually appealing design throughout the application. The design of this web app was created with modern aesthetics, employing a simple yet elegant color palette and clean design principles to ensure a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface.

**The CSS files are separated into distinct categories:**

products.css = This is the styling file for templates that display products( index, books...). It is simple and modern. I chose gold as a color for the price to break the color pattern and to highlight it.

styles.css = This is the styling file for the layout template.
 *You can notice that almost all the templates in one way or another have the a very close deign pattern.*
